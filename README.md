## Tiny Defender

Defend your tiny world against the incoming asteroid storm as long as you can.

Basic block will destroy one incoming threat only but are far cheaper than turrets in ressources. Don't forget you can shoot straight up to help defend and jump around to gather every last bit of ressources.

Have fun!
